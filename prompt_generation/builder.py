Your task: Create a 100% accurate, highly effective master prompt for an AI agent based on the provided details.

CRITICAL RULES (structure fidelity):
1. The generated prompt MUST have these sections in order: ROLE, GOAL, PROCESS STEPS, AFTER EXECUTION REVIEW, and OUTPUT FORMAT.
2. Use the CANONICAL STRUCTURE below as a baseline for the layout, but prioritize the specific user inputs provided.
3. If the user provided specific steps, use them exactly. If they are vague, expand them into professional, executable instructions.
4. The 'AFTER EXECUTION REVIEW' section should include automated self-checks for the agent to ensure high-quality output.
5. No AI-hype, no emojis, no preamble. Just the final Markdown document.

CANONICAL STRUCTURE (Baseline):
